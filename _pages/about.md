Noah's ARK is an informal collection of researchers, led by [Prof. Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io) within the [Natural Language Processing](https://nlp.washington.edu) group and the [Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.uw.edu) and formerly at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu)'s [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) and [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/).

* We have published [numerous papers about NLP](https://nasmith.github.io/publications/); data and code is linked within each paper.

* Project pages, datasets, and code from 2006&ndash;2015 can be found on our page at [CMU](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/). 

If you are an undergraduate or masters student in Seattle and would
like to work on research with Noah's ARK, please complete this [demonstration of research interest](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/temp/challenge.pdf).
